# Final-Project
Healthcare appointments no-show prediction project
 Objective:
To analyze healthcare appointment data and identify patterns in patient no-shows using Power BI. The goal is to optimize scheduling and reduce missed appointments.

 Tools Used:
Power BI for data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation.

 Dataset Overview:
Contains patient appointment records with fields like:
PatientID, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, No-show, etc.

 Steps Involved:
Data Import & Cleaning
Loaded the CSV into Power BI.
Removed irrelevant/corrupted entries (e.g., missing values, canceled appointments).
Corrected data types (dates, numerical formats).
Exploratory Analysis

Analyzed no-show trends by:
Day of the week
Identified high no-show segments visually.

KPI Cards & Visuals

Created cards for:
Total Appointments
No-shows
Show Rate (%)

Developed bar, line, and pie charts to show:
No-shows by weekday
Appointment distribution over time

Insights & Recommendations
Most no-shows occurred on Sundays and Wednesdays.
Suggest scheduling follow-ups and reminders more strategically.

 Deliverables:
Power BI Dashboard (interactive)

PDF Report Summary

Optimization Recommendations

 Conclusion:
Using Power BI, this project uncovered actionable insights that healthcare administrators can use to improve attendance rates. Although predictive modeling wasn't done inside Power BI, the analysis forms the foundation for integrating future ML-based alerts or scheduling improvements.
